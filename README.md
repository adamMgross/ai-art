# Machine Learning Art Classifier: *Adam Gross and Josh Palmer*
This is the project page for our Project in Artificial Intelligence class. The goal of this project is to build a classification algorithm using machine learning. We are interested in classifying art images as either impressionist or surrealist. Our dataset consists of images scraped from [Arsty.net](artsy.net). Following the curriculum of the class, we are implementing ID3, Stochastic Gradient Descent on a Neural Network, and more as the semester moves forward.
